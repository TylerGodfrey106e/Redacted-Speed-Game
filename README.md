# Redacted_Speed_Game

## Overview
We created a 2 player speed card game with:
- login system with hashed passwords using a salt
- functioning chat room with predetermined chat options
- joinable rooms to play the game

## Technologies Used
- MongoDB
- Express
- React
- Nodejs
- HTML, CSS
- Javascript

## My Contributions
I worked on connecting the project to the database as well as getting the server to send the correct data to the players by using sockets.

## Challenges
A big challenge was learning how to use sockets to allow the server to communicate to the clients. This is used both in the chat and to send game information to each person. 

We also learned how to create user authentcation by hashing the password and combining it with a salt to make it secure as the password crosses the web to the database.
